# Webscraping is a process that can be used to automatically extract information from a website,
# and can easily be accomplished within a matter of minutes and not hours. 

# In short term, Getting data from html web pages

# Beautiful Soup Objects 
# Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files, 
# we will focus on HTML files. This is accomplished by representing the HTML as a set of objects with methods used to parse the HTML. 
# We can navigate the HTML as a tree and/or filter out what we are looking for.

# The find_all() method looks through a tagâ€™s descendants and retrieves all descendants that match your filters.
# The Method signature for find_all(name, attrs, recursive, string, limit, **kwargs)
# We can store it as a string in the variable table:
table_bs = BeautifulSoup(table, "html.parser")

# ---------------------------------------------------
table_bs.find_all(id="flight")

# find all the elements without href value
table_bs.find_all(href=False)

# With string you can search for strings instead of tags,
# where we find all the elments with Florida.
table_bs.find_all(string="Florida")
